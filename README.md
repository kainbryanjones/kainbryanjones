# Kain Bryan-Jones
Enthusiastic frontend developwe with skills in application development, music production and animation. Looking to get my foot in the door of the music software industry.

As a young musician myself, I have experience within the world of music production including the tools used to help facilitate it. With this personal experience and my background in software development, I have a strong desire to build quality products to assist other musicians in their own journey, whether they want to be a casual four-chord player or a professional multi-instrumentalist.
